## How to use

Paste to your AI (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, …):

```
Read this skill and use it: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydisha/keirouter/main/skills/keirouter/SKILL.md
```

Then ask normally — *"generate an image of a cat"*, *"transcribe this URL"*, etc.

## Configure your shell once

```bash
export KEIROUTER_URL="http://localhost:20180"   # local default, or your VPS / tunnel URL
export KEIROUTER_KEY="sk-..."                   # from Dashboard → Keys (only if auth enabled)
```

Verify: `curl $KEIROUTER_URL/healthz` → `{"ok":true}`.
